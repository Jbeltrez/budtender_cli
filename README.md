# BudtenderCli

 
For my first cli project I wanted to create a cli gem with some decent and useful functionality for the user rather than just allowing the user to view data. This cli is essentially a pharmacy for medical marijuana cannabis. The user will be able to be prescribed a strain of marijuana based on a desired effect. User input is heavily relied on to be able to instantiate prescription objects as well as set attributes via user input that can later be viewed while still in the pharmacy. 

<!-- Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/budtender_cli`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt. -->

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'budtender_cli'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install budtender_cli

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
